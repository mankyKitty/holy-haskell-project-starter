## Holy Haskell Project Starter

This is my implementation of the truly awesome Haskell tutorial by
[Yann Esposito](https://twitter.com/yogsototh) that is located
[here](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Holy-Haskell-Starter/).

The binary when it's all built and lovely comes in at a rather
staggering __23Mb__. But it works wonderfully and I'll continue to
tweak it I think.

I highly recommend the tutorial and Haskell in general. This was a lot
of fun.
